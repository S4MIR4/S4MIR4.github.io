I am a current PhD student at the University of Edinburgh supervised by
Dr. Matthias Hennig. I conduct research in both computational neuroscience and machine learning. My work focuses on the development and deployment of scalable methods for the analysis of large-scale extracellular recordings. I also work to improve the reproducibility and provenance of extracellular analysis in preparation for the wide-spread use of large-scale electrophysiology. I am a firm believer that both of these research directions are essential for the current and future health of neuroscience and I am passionate about developing principled technologies to drive them forward.
