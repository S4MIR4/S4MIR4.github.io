Research
=========

I am a recent Masterâ€™s degree student with a strong foundation in computational chemistry, data science, drug
design, materials-focused modeling, and molecular simulations. During my MSc, I applied Density Functional
Theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate charge transfer mechanisms through Charge
Decomposition Analysis and molecular interactions in axonal, synaptic, and astrocytic neuronal gap junctions,
as well as the overlying water layers that serve as a medium for partial electronic charge transfer from glial cells
to synaptic membranes. My primary analytical tool is Python, which I use to develop custom scripts for data
processing, automation, and visualization. I also have extensive experience with Bash and command-line tools
for managing large-scale computational workflows on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. My research
so far has focused on applying quantum mechanical (QM) methods, particularly DFT, to a range of metallic and
biochemical systems.
