Research
======
I am a researcher at the Center for Integrated Neuroplasticity [CINPLA](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/fyscell/cinpla/), at the University of Oslo.
My research is about combining neurotechnology, computational neuroscience, and neural engineering to improve electrophysiological techniques in neuroscience.
