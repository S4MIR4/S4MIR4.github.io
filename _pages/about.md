Research
=========

I am an engineer and software developer focused on methods and analysis tools for neuroscience research,
especially for extracellular electrophysiology. I am passionate about science, software, and engineering, and
my mission is to support neuroscientists and facilitate their research efforts by providing state-of-the-art
analysis methods and software tools. Among these, I am the core developer of several open-source scientific
tools, including [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a widely used software framework 
to unify and simplify the analysis of extracellular electrophysiology data. 

In March 2022, I joined the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics team as an electrophysiology pipeline development 
engineer consultant, with the goal of building open-source and computationally efficient processing pipelines to 
analyze large amounts of electrophysiological data.
Since July 2020, I have been working part-time at [CatalystNeuro](https://www.catalystneuro.com/), a consulting company 
with the mission of facilitating collaborations in neuroscience and standardizing data analysis and data storage 
solutions. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Bio Engineering Lab](https://bsse.ethz.ch/bel) at ETH, working on 
multimodal approaches to probe neural activity and to construct detailed biophysical models. Before that I was at the 
Center for Integrated Neuroplasticity [CINPLA](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/fyscell/cinpla/), 
at the University of Oslo, where I received my PhD.
