Research
======
I am a current PhD student in the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation at University of Edinburgh supervised by
[Dr. Matthias Hennig](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mhennig/). My research interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning and my PhD focuses on the development and deployment of scalable methods for the analysis of large-scale extracellular recordings. I also work to improve the reproducibility and provenance of extracellular analysis in preparation for the wide-spread use of large-scale electrophysiology. I am a firm believer that both of these research directions are essential for the current and future health of neuroscience and I am passionate about developing principled technologies to drive them forward.
