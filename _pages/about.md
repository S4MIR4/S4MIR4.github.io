Research
=========
I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Bio Engineering Lab](https://bsse.ethz.ch/bel) at ETH. Previously at the Center for Integrated Neuroplasticity [CINPLA](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/fyscell/cinpla/), at the University of Oslo, where I received my PhD.
My research combines neurotechnology, computational neuroscience, and neural engineering to improve electrophysiological techniques in neuroscience.
I'm particularly interested in advanced recording and stimulation modalities to probe neural activity, in biophysically detailed computational models of neurons, and large-scale analysis of electrophysiology recordings (especially spike sorting!).
