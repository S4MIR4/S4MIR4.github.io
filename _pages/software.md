# Electrophysiology


- [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface): unified and open-source Python framework for spike sorting. 
Features include loading/saving in several file format, pre-, post-processing, running 10+ different spike sorters, 
validation (quality metrics - QC), export to [Phy](https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy), automatic curation based on QC, comparison between sorting outputs, and visualization widgets.

- Open-Ephys plugins: collection of plugins for the [Open-Ephys](https://open-ephys.org/) system
    - [tracking-plugin](https://github.com/CINPLA/tracking-plugin): plugin for tracking animals and closed-loop stimulation based on real time position. It works in combination with [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/).
    - [logic-gate-plugin](https://github.com/CINPLA/logic-gate-plugin): plugin to combine TTL inputs with logic gates.
    - [sync-plugin](https://github.com/CINPLA/sync-plugin): plugin to generate software-generated TTL that can be used to sync instrumentation.  

- [Pyopenephys](https://github.com/CINPLA/pyopenephys): Python package to parse Open-Ephys recordings (openephys and binary format)

- [Pyintan](https://github.com/alejoe91/pyintan): Python package to parse Intan recordings (.rhd and .rhs)

- [SpyICA](https://github.com/alejoe91/spyica): Python package for ICA-based spike sorting. Compatible with the SpikeInterface framework


# Simulators

- [MEArec](https://github.com/alejoe91/MEArec): Python-based simulator of extracellular spiking activity for spike sorting development and validation.
Features include: replication of bursting, control of spatio-temporal collisions, slow and fast drifts, several noise models. Fully interfaced with SpikeInterface. 

- [MEAutility](https://github.com/alejoe91/MEAutility): Python package for defining and dealing with probe geometries and simulating electric potentials 
generated by electrical stimulation. It includes pretty plotting functions!

- [nEuronMI](https://github.com/miroK/nEuronMI): Python package based on [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) and [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) 
for simulating neuronal activity using the finite element method.
It includes the full 3d-3d EMI model (Extracellular-Membrane-Intracellular) and it supports the hybrid solution.

# Data management

- [Expipe](https://github.com/CINPLA/pyopenephys): Python package for managing experimental projects. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) and 
it's extendible with plugins to customize its use for different requirements.
