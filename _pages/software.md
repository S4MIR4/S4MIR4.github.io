Role: Author

A Python framework designed to unify preexisting spike sorting technologies into a single code base. With SpikeInterface, users are able to run and compare many popular, semi-automatic spike sorting algorithms, pre-process and post-process extracellular datasets, calculate quality metrics, visualize raw and sorted data, and more, with only a few lines of code, regardless of the underlying data format.

Role: Developer

A method for automated spike sorting for recordings with high-density, large-scale multielectrode arrays. Exploiting the dense sampling of single neurons by multiple electrodes, an efficient, low-dimensional representation of detected spikes consisting of estimated spatial spike locations and dominant spike shape features is exploited for fast and reliable clustering into single units.
